BLACKBRIDGE LOGISTICS 2026 Comprehensive Growth Plan From $12K to $100K Monthly Net Profit Document Information Prepared: January 2026 Data Source: 880 Loads from Alvys TMS Analysis Period: May 2024 – January 2026 Loads with Complete Margin Data: 774 THE CORE THESIS BlackBridge has proven product-market fit with $160,939 in gross margin across 774 loads. The constraint is not the market or the service—it's sales capacity. Patrick is structurally prevented from selling due to operational demands. Fix that, and the path to $100K monthly profit becomes execution, not experimentation.

Every number here comes from real transactions. 1.1 Overall Performance Metric Value Total Revenue (All Time) $1,068,130 Total Gross Margin $160,939 Loads Analyzed 774 (with complete margin data) Average Margin per Load $208 Average Margin Percentage 15.1% Current Monthly Run Rate ~71 loads/month Current Monthly Profit (Est.) ~$12,000-15,000 These numbers represent a real business with real customers paying real money. The foundation is solid—we're not trying to prove the model works. We're trying to scale it. 1.2 January 2026 Snapshot January represents our most recent complete month and shows the current operational baseline: Metric January 2026 Total Loads 75 Revenue $127,705 Gross Margin $17,846 Margin per Load $238 (above historical average) Active Customers 7 January's higher margin per load ($238 vs. $208 average) suggests we're getting better at pricing or selecting loads. This is worth monitoring—can we sustain $230+ margins at scale? 1.3 Customer Profitability Analysis Not all customers are created equal. Our data reveals significant variation in margin per load across accounts. Understanding this matters for prioritization. Top Performing External Customers (by margin/load) Customer Loads Total Margin Avg Margin/Load Assessment Vibra Screw 22 $9,152 $416 Ideal profile—high margin, consistent Radiant Logistics 29 $8,207 $283 Strong performer Frontier Door 75 $18,825 $251 Core customer—volume + margin Clearway High Vol High $200+ Core customer—scale opportunity ReWorld Growing Growing $220+ Growing account What makes a good customer?  High margin per load ($200+), consistent volume, reasonable service requirements, and payment reliability. Vibra Screw is the template—find more like them. Accounts Removed or Under Review Customer Historical Loads Avg Margin Status Reason DH Companies 21 $355 TERMINATED Litigation Dessin Haus 9 $359 TERMINATED Litigation Aetna Various Various TERMINATED Litigation BlackBridge Recycling 37 $87 INTERNAL Deprioritize—margin too low CRITICAL INSIGHT: CONCENTRATION RISK With terminated accounts removed, customer concentration is acute. Clearway and Frontier Door represent a large share of margin. If either relationship weakens, we're in trouble. The 2026 strategy must aggressively prioritize diversification—no single customer should exceed 15% of margin by year end. 1.4 Lane Profitability Lane analysis reveals where we make money and where we lose it. This should inform both sales targeting and operations decisions. High-Margin Lanes (Expand) Lane Loads Avg Margin Opportunity Tacoma WA → El Paso TX 7 $620 Target customers with similar lanes Chicago IL (Local) 8 $422 Build carrier density for local work Commerce CA → Saginaw MI 5 $375 Long-haul with good rate Various FL lanes Multiple $300+ Strong market for us Margin-Destroying Lanes (Avoid or Reprice) Lane Loads Avg Margin Action Woodland WA → Vernon CA 8 $32 DO NOT BOOK at current rates Ridgefield WA → Vernon CA 5 $30 DO NOT BOOK at current rates LANE RULE Do not book WA/OR → Vernon CA lanes unless the customer agrees to a rate increase of at least $250. These lanes destroy margin and should be avoided or repriced. When a customer asks for these lanes, quote $250+ higher than market. Part 2: Why the Current Approach Won't Work 2.1 The Fundamental Structural Problem BlackBridge does not have a sales problem. It does not have a market problem. It has a role clarity problem that makes sustained growth impossible. Patrick is currently responsible for both sales AND operations. This is a structural impossibility. Here's why: THE INCOMPATIBILITY Sales and operations are fundamentally incompatible workflows. Operations is reactive—phones ring, problems happen, fires need putting out. It rewards responsiveness and firefighting. Sales is proactive—it requires protected time, mental focus, and consistency. It rewards persistence and follow-through. When both responsibilities live in one person, operations always wins. The ringing phone beats the prospect list every time. 2.2 The Math That Proves It Let's quantify the problem: Patrick's Current State Value Calls per day (estimated) 0-10 Calls per week 0-50 Connect rate 15-20% Conversations per week 0-10 Qualified prospects per month 2-4 New customers per month 1 (maybe) At 1 new customer per month, reaching 65+ active customers takes 5+ years. Even at 2 customers per month, we're looking at 3 years to reach target. This pace does not get us to $100K monthly profit by December 2026. This is not a motivation problem. This is not a skill problem. This is a math problem.  The structure prevents success. 2.3 What Has to Change Three structural changes must happen immediately: 1.  Patrick must be freed from operations entirely. David takes 100% of load execution, customer service, and carrier management for existing accounts. No exceptions during calling blocks. 2.  Sales activity must be measured and enforced. 200+ dials per week is the minimum. This is logged in HubSpot, reviewed daily by Chris, and non-negotiable. 3.  Cold email becomes a force multiplier. Instantly.ai warms prospects before Patrick calls, turning cold calls into warm conversations. 2.4 Responsibility Matrix: Who Handles What To eliminate confusion, here's exactly who handles what: Situation Primary Owner Escalation Path Customer calls about load status David Vin if unresolved >2 hrs Carrier is late or no-shows David Vin for rebooking decisions Customer wants a rate quote (new prospect) Patrick Chris if pricing dispute Customer wants a rate quote (existing) David Chris if pricing dispute New prospect responds to email Patrick Chris for deal support Customer complaint about service David Vin, then Chris if relationship at risk Carrier needs payment David Vin for approval Cargo damage or claim David Vin, then Jason for major claims THE RULE If it's about an existing load or customer operations: David owns it. If it's about winning new business: Patrick owns it. There is no middle ground during protected calling time. Part 3: The Target and the Math 3.1 The Goal DECEMBER 2026 TARGET $100,000 net profit per month from freight brokerage operations. This is not revenue—this is profit after paying carriers, team, and overhead. This requires approximately $670,000 in monthly gross revenue, or 481 loads per month at $208 average margin. 3.2 The Growth Math Variable Value Notes Target Monthly Net Profit $100,000 The goal Average Margin per Load $208 Historical average Required Monthly Loads 481 $100K ÷ $208 Current Monthly Loads ~71 January baseline Required Growth Multiple 6.8x 481 ÷ 71 Growing 6.8x in one year is aggressive but achievable with the right team structure and consistent execution. The key is understanding that growth comes from customer acquisition and retention, not from squeezing more loads out of existing customers. 3.3 Customer Acquisition Math Customers don't arrive at full volume. They ramp over months as trust builds: Time with BlackBridge Typical Loads/Month Monthly Margin Customer Status Month 1 1-2 $200-400 Trial period—proving ourselves Month 2 4-6 $800-1,200 Building confidence Month 3 8-12 $1,600-2,400 Regular shipper Month 4-5 12-15 $2,400-3,000 Growing relationship Month 6+ 15-25 $3,000-5,000 Established—core customer The implication:  A customer acquired in January doesn't contribute $4,000/month until June. A customer acquired in October barely contributes anything meaningful before December. This is why early acquisition matters—we need customers ramping all year. 3.4 Customer Value Growth Over Time This table shows how a single customer's contribution grows: Month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7-12 Loads/Month 1.5 5 10 12 15 18 20 Margin/Month $312 $1,040 $2,080 $2,496 $3,120 $3,744 $4,160 Cumulative $312 $1,352 $3,432 $5,928 $9,048 $12,792 $37,752 A customer acquired in January and retained all year generates approximately $38,000 in margin. A customer acquired in July generates only about $15,000 by December. Start early. 3.5 Acquisition Rate Required To reach 65-70 active customers by December, accounting for churn: Quarter New Customers Needed Cumulative Active (End) Monthly Run Rate Q1 (Jan-Mar) 12-15 22-25 4-5 new/month Q2 (Apr-Jun) 15-18 35-40 5-6 new/month Q3 (Jul-Sep) 18-20 50-55 6-7 new/month Q4 (Oct-Dec) 18-20 65-70 6-7 new/month Translation:  4-6 new customers per month starting in February, ramping to 6-7 by summer. This requires consistent, sustained sales activity—not occasional bursts of effort. Part 4: The Team Structure 4.1 Current Team and Responsibilities Person Role Primary Responsibilities Location Jason President Strategy, technology, major account decisions, capital allocation West Palm Beach Vin Operations Lead Strategy execution, ops management, David oversight, carrier strategy Colorado Chris Sales Lead Sales team management, Patrick oversight, customer relationships, pricing NJ/NY Patrick Sales Rep Outbound prospecting, lead qualification, closing new accounts NJ/NY David Operations Load execution, carrier management, customer service, tracking NJ/NY 4.2 Clear Accountability Each person owns specific outcomes. There's no shared accountability—one person is responsible, others support. Outcome Owner Support New customer acquisition Patrick Chris (coaching), David (first load execution) Load execution quality David Vin (escalation), Patrick (relationship issues) Sales team performance Chris Jason (strategy) Operations performance Vin Jason (strategy) Carrier network development David Vin (strategy) Overall business results Jason Vin, Chris 4.3 The Handoff Protocol When Patrick closes a new customer, the handoff to David must be clean: 1.  Patrick books and monitors the first load personally—he made the promise, he delivers on it 2.  After successful first delivery, Patrick sends intro email to customer copying David 3.  Patrick stays available for relationship escalations only—not day-to-day ops 4.  David owns all operational communication from second load forward 5.  Customer profile and notes updated in HubSpot before handoff 4.4 Can Patrick Alone Hit $100K? Short answer: No.  Here's the detailed analysis: One sales rep doing 200 dials/week with good list quality and solid pitch can close 4-6 new customers per month. Let's be optimistic and say 5 per month sustained. Scenario New Customers Months Total Acquired After 15% Churn Patrick alone @ 5/month 5 12 60 ~51 active Target needed — — — 65-70 active Patrick alone gets us close but not there—and that assumes perfect execution with zero bad months. We need margin for error and we need to exceed the target to account for unknowns. 4.5 Hiring Strategy: Performance-Triggered We don't hire based on projections. We hire based on proven performance: Hire Trigger What This Proves Expected Timeline Sales Rep #2 Patrick closes 4+ accounts/month for 2 consecutive months The sales system works and can be replicated Q2 (Apr-May) Ops Coordinator David managing 150+ loads/month Volume requires support Q2-Q3 Sales Rep #3 Rep #2 reaches 3+ accounts/month, pipeline overflowing System scales beyond one person Q3 (Aug) Sales Rep #4 Team hitting 12+ combined accounts/month Final push to target Q4 (if needed) THE PRINCIPLE Hire based on proven performance, not projected revenue. Patrick must prove the system works before we replicate it. Each hire is triggered by demonstrated results, not hope. 4.6 Cost of New Hires Role Base Salary Commission Total Cost/Month Break-Even Sales Rep $4,000 ~$2,000 at target $6,000 3 customers/month Ops Coordinator $3,500 — $3,500 60 loads/month support A sales rep costs roughly $6,000/month fully loaded. They need to close 3 customers per month to break even (each customer worth ~$2,000 in first-month margin). Target is 4-5, making them profitable within 60 days of ramping. Part 5: The Sales System – Cold Calling 5.1 Why Cold Calling is the Foundation In freight brokerage, the phone is where deals close. Email opens doors, but the phone builds relationships. Here's why: – Logistics managers are busy and skeptical—they've been burned by bad brokers before – They won't respond to emails from unknown brokers, but they'll take a call from someone who sounds competent – Trust is built through conversation, not text – Objections can be handled in real-time on the phone – The phone creates urgency and commitment that email cannot 5.2 Activity Targets NON-NEGOTIABLE MINIMUMS 40+ dials per day | 200+ dials per week | 800+ dials per month. These are minimums, not goals. Top performers exceed these numbers. The Conversion Funnel Metric Rate Weekly Result Monthly Result Dials — 200 800 Connect Rate 15-20% 30-40 conversations 120-160 Qualify Rate (of conversations) 25% 8-10 qualified 32-40 Close Rate (of qualified) 50% 4-5 new customers 16-20 These conversion rates are achievable with good list quality and a solid pitch. The key insight: activity drives results. More dials = more conversations = more customers. There's no shortcut. 5.3 Patrick's Daily Schedule Calling requires protected time. This schedule creates three protected calling blocks totaling 4.5 hours: Time Activity Duration Notes 8:00-8:15 Setup: CRM, call list, review notes 15 min Prepare before calling 8:15-10:00 PROTECTED CALLING BLOCK #1 1hr 45min Target: 20 dials 10:00-10:30 Break: Email, CRM updates, bathroom 30 min Log calls, update notes 10:30-12:00 PROTECTED CALLING BLOCK #2 1hr 30min Target: 15 dials 12:00-12:30 Lunch 30 min — 12:30-2:00 Follow-ups, quotes, warm prospects 1hr 30min Work pipeline 2:00-3:30 PROTECTED CALLING BLOCK #3 1hr 30min Target: 10 dials 3:30-5:00 Admin, pipeline review, EOD report 1hr 30min Daily summary to Chris PROTECTED TIME RULE During calling blocks, Patrick does NOT handle operations. Phone on silent for non-sales calls. No email checking. No 'quick favors.' David and Vin handle all ops issues. If the building isn't on fire, it can wait 90 minutes. 5.4 The Call Framework This is Version 1.0 of the script. We'll track what works and refine monthly with Chris. The goal is not to read a script—it's to have a natural conversation guided by a framework. The Opening (First 10 Seconds) You have 10 seconds to earn 30 more seconds. Get to the point: "Hi [Name], this is Patrick with BlackBridge Logistics. I know I'm catching you cold—do you have 30 seconds?" – Use their name—shows you did research – Acknowledge you're interrupting—shows respect for their time – Ask for 30 seconds, not 5 minutes—lower commitment The Hook (Next 15 Seconds) Give them a reason to keep listening: "We specialize in [FTL/expedited] for [their industry—manufacturing, building products, etc.]. I'm not calling to replace anyone—I'm calling because when your current carrier drops the ball, you need a backup who can actually perform. I'd rather have that conversation now than when you're in crisis mode." – Specific to their business (shows you know their industry) – Not trying to replace—lowers resistance – Frames the conversation around their future problem, not your need to sell Qualifying Questions If they're willing to talk, learn about their situation: – "How are you handling your freight right now—in-house team or outside partners?" – "What's your mix—mostly regional or cross-country?" – "How many loads are you moving per week typically?" – "When was the last time a carrier let you down? What happened?" – "What would need to happen for you to try a new broker?" Listen more than you talk. Take notes. Their words become your follow-up ammunition. Common Objections and Responses Objection Response "We're happy with our current broker" "That's great—means you know what good service looks like. I'm not asking to replace them. I'm asking to be the call you make when they can't cover a load or when you need expedited help. Can I send you our rate sheet to have on file?" "We don't use brokers" "Makes sense—a lot of companies feel that way until they get stuck. When you have a hot load and your regular carriers are booked, who do you call? I'd like to be that backup option." "Send me your info / email me" "Happy to. What's the best email? And just so I send you something relevant—are you mostly moving dry van, flatbed, or a mix?" "Not interested" "I hear you. Quick question before I go—is it because you're fully covered, or because you've had bad experiences with brokers before?" What Counts as a Successful Call? Success means moving the prospect forward, not necessarily closing. Any of these outcomes count as wins: Outcome Why It's a Win Next Step Agrees to receive a rate quote Shows interest in pricing Send quote within 2 hours—speed matters Schedules a callback Committed their time Calendar invite immediately, prepare for call Shares a pain point Trust building, insight gained Document in HubSpot, use in follow-up "Not now but call me in X weeks" Door is open, timing issue Set task for exact date, note the reason Reached DM, learned their situation Relationship started Add to nurture sequence, warm email follow-up Good conversation, no immediate need They know who you are 30-day follow-up, stay on radar SCRIPT ITERATION PROCESS Weekly: Patrick and Chris review which openers got best responses, which objection handlers worked. Monthly: Formal script review based on conversion data. Update the framework with what's working. This isn't a perfect script—it's a starting point we improve over time. Part 6: The Sales System – Cold Email (Instantly.ai) 6.1 What Is Cold Email? Cold email is sending personalized, one-to-one business emails to prospects who haven't opted in. Done right, it's legitimate business development. Done wrong, it's spam that damages your reputation. Cold Email (What We Do) Spam (What We Avoid) Sent to relevant decision-makers Random purchased lists with no targeting Personalized to recipient's role/company Generic mass messages to everyone Easy to unsubscribe No opt-out or hidden opt-out Low volume (50-100/day/mailbox) High volume blasts (1000s/day) From real person with real reply-to From no-reply addresses Value-focused messaging Pushy sales language 6.2 What Is Instantly.ai? Instantly.ai is a cold email platform that automates personalized email sequences while protecting your domain reputation. Key features: – Sends from multiple email addresses to distribute volume – Automatically warms up new domains to build sender reputation – Sends follow-up sequences without manual work – Stops sequences when someone replies (no annoying over-emailing) – Tracks opens, clicks, and replies so you know what's working Cost: $97/month for the Growth plan (up to 5,000 contacts/month, unlimited sending accounts) 6.3 Why We Need Multiple Domains Sending cold email from your main domain (blackbridgelogistics.com) is risky. If recipients mark you as spam, your main domain reputation suffers and regular business emails go to spam. Solution: secondary domains. Domain Type Use Risk Level blackbridgelogistics.com Regular business email only Protect at all costs blackbridgelog.com Cold email sending Acceptable if burned bblogistics.co Cold email sending Acceptable if burned blackbridge-freight.com Cold email sending Acceptable if burned Each domain gets 3 email addresses (e.g., patrick@, p.kelly@, pkelly@). 3 domains × 3 addresses = 9 sending accounts. 6.4 Domain Warmup Schedule New email addresses need warmup before sending cold email. Instantly.ai handles this automatically: Week Daily Sends Per Account Total Daily (9 accounts) Notes 1-2 10-20 90-180 Warmup phase—system sends test emails 3-4 30-50 270-450 Building reputation 5-6 50-80 450-720 Approaching full volume 7+ 80-100 720-900 Full sending capacity This means cold email doesn't reach full effectiveness until week 5-6. Plan accordingly—start warmup in January for February production. 6.5 Email Sequence Structure Each prospect receives a 4-email sequence over 12 days: Email Day Purpose Approach Email 1 Day 1 Introduction Quick intro, one specific value prop, soft CTA Email 2 Day 4 Value Add Share relevant insight, build credibility Email 3 Day 8 Social Proof Reference similar company success, case study hint Email 4 Day 12 Breakup Final attempt, permission to close file If no reply after Email 4, contact goes dormant. Revisit in 90 days with fresh angle. 6.6 How 5,000 Leads Flow Through With 5,000 contacts loaded and 9 sending accounts: Week New Contacts Starting Emails Sent Expected Replies (3%) Week 1-2 1,500 1,500 30-45 replies Week 3-4 +1,500 (3,000 total) 4,500 60-90 replies Week 5-6 +1,000 (4,000 total) 8,000 90-135 replies Week 7-8 Completing sequences 12,000+ 120-180 replies total A 5,000-contact list takes 8-10 weeks to fully process through all sequences. Plan for quarterly ZoomInfo pulls to maintain fresh pipeline. 6.7 Expected Conversion Rates Metric Conservative Target Optimistic Reply Rate 2% 3% 5% Positive Replies (% of all replies) 40% 50% 60% Qualified (% of positive) 60% 70% 80% First Load (% of qualified) 40% 50% 60% Customers from 5,000 leads 10-12 15-20 25-30 At target rates: 5,000 leads → 150 replies → 75 positive → 52 qualified → 26 first loads → 20+ customers over ~3 months. 6.8 Expected ROI Cost Item Monthly Cost Instantly.ai (Growth plan) $97 3 Secondary Domains $3 (yearly, amortized) ZoomInfo (prorated share) ~$200 Patrick's time (5 hrs/week) Included in salary TOTAL MONTHLY COST ~$333 ROI SUMMARY For approximately $333/month in direct costs, cold email should generate 5-8 new customers per month. Each customer is worth ~$15,000 in first-year margin. That's 40-60x return on investment. Even at half the expected performance, it's 20-30x ROI. 6.9 How Cold Email Changes Patrick's Day Before (Cold Calling Only) After (Cold Email + Calling) 6+ hours cold calling strangers 1-2 hours responding to warm email replies 100% cold leads—no context Mix of cold calls + warm leads who raised their hand Low conversion on first calls 5x higher conversion on email-warmed prospects Single channel—all eggs in one basket Diversified pipeline—multiple lead sources Discouraging rejection rate Positive replies create momentum Cold email doesn't replace cold calling—it makes cold calling more effective by warming prospects and creating inbound interest. Part 7: Lead Generation Strategy (ZoomInfo) This section explains WHO we target, WHY they're ideal prospects, and HOW to build lists that convert. 7.1 Volume Requirements: The Math Working backwards from our customer target to determine how many leads we need: Stage Monthly Need Conversion How We Get There Target: New Customers 5-6 Goal Our target First Loads Booked 8-10 60% stick rate Not everyone becomes repeat Qualified Prospects 25-30 35% close rate Has freight, authority, timeline Positive Replies 50-60 50% qualify rate Interested but needs vetting Total Email Replies 100-120 50% positive rate Not all replies are positive Emails Sent ~6,000 3% reply rate Industry standard for B2B Fresh Contacts Needed ~1,500 Primary list New contacts per month Add cold calling requirements: 800 dials/month needs 400-500 contacts with direct phone numbers (16-20% connect rate means we dial each contact ~4x on average). QUARTERLY PULL 5,000 contacts from ZoomInfo lasts approximately 3 months. Pull quarterly, refresh monthly with job changers (new hires at companies are 5x more likely to try new vendors). 7.2 Why These Industries? We target specific manufacturing industries based on three criteria that predict brokerage success: Criterion 1: Consistent FTL Volume They ship full truckloads regularly—not sporadically. We want companies that move freight every week, not once a quarter. Manufacturing represents 32% of all FTL freight volume nationally, the largest single sector. These companies have production schedules that generate predictable freight. Criterion 2: Value Reliability Over Lowest Price Production delays from late shipments cost them real money—sometimes $10,000-50,000 per hour in lost production. They'll pay more for a broker who doesn't drop the ball. Price-only buyers are not our target. Criterion 3: Right Company Size Big enough to ship regularly (50+ employees), but not so big they have dedicated fleets or locked-in national contracts (500+ employees). Mid-size manufacturers need the flexibility and service that brokers provide. 7.3 Target List 1: Building Products & Construction Materials These companies manufacture heavy, bulky products that require FTL shipping to construction sites, distributors, and retailers. High volume, regional routes, consistent demand tied to construction activity. Why They Need Brokers – Heavy products = full truckloads (no LTL option for cement, concrete, metal frames) – Construction timelines are unforgiving—late delivery stops the job site – Regional distribution to builders, contractors, and big-box retailers – Seasonal peaks require overflow carrier capacity they don't have in-house – Many are mid-size companies without dedicated logistics teams NAICS Codes NAICS Industry Why Good for FTL Typical Freight 327310 Cement Manufacturing Heavy, consistent, regional delivery Bulk cement to ready-mix plants 327320 Ready-Mix Concrete Construction-tied, time-sensitive Delivery to job sites 327331 Concrete Block & Brick Heavy products, regional Building materials to sites 321911 Wood Windows & Doors Bulky, fragile, regional distribution To builders, home centers 321918 Other Millwork/Flooring Building materials, consistent Flooring, trim to distributors 332321 Metal Windows & Doors Heavy, weather-dependent demand Commercial construction 332311 Prefab Metal Buildings Large components, project-based Steel buildings to sites 321992 Prefab Wood Buildings Modular construction boom Modular homes, structures ZoomInfo Filters:  75-500 employees | $15M-$300M revenue | FL, GA, NC, TX, AZ, CO (construction-heavy states) Target Titles:  Logistics Manager, Transportation Manager, Shipping Manager, Supply Chain Manager, Plant Manager, Operations Director 7.4 Target List 2: Metal Fabrication & Industrial Products Fabricated metal products ship to other manufacturers, construction sites, and industrial customers. These are relationship businesses—once you're in, you stay in for years. Why They Need Brokers – Custom and made-to-order products = variable shipping needs week to week – Heavy materials often require flatbed or specialized equipment – Ship to multiple manufacturing customers with JIT requirements – Often family-owned businesses that lack in-house logistics expertise – Value relationships and reliability over lowest price NAICS Codes NAICS Industry Why Good for FTL Typical Freight 332312 Fabricated Structural Metal Heavy, construction-tied Steel beams, frames to job sites 332322 Sheet Metal Work HVAC, roofing, industrial applications Ductwork, panels 332710 Machine Shops Parts to assembly plants, JIT Machined components 332999 Misc Fabricated Metal Custom products, varied needs Specialty metal products 332510 Hardware Manufacturing Distribution to retailers Hardware to big-box stores 333120 Construction Machinery Mfg Heavy equipment, time-sensitive Machinery, parts 333413 Industrial Pump Mfg Industrial customers, critical parts Pumps, components 333923 Overhead Crane Mfg Project-based, large shipments Cranes, hoists ZoomInfo Filters:  50-400 employees | $10M-$200M revenue | OH, MI, IN, IL, PA, TX (manufacturing belt) 7.5 Target List 3: Plastics & Packaging Plastics manufacturers ship high-volume, lightweight but space-consuming products. Consistent demand, repeat routes, loyal customers once you prove reliability. Why They Need Brokers – Lightweight but bulky = fills trucks without maxing weight (cubing out) – Ship to manufacturers, distributors, retailers—multiple channels – Packaging demand is recession-resistant (everyone needs packaging) – Regional distribution centers need regular replenishment – Often running 24/7 production with constant shipping needs NAICS Codes NAICS Industry Why Good for FTL Typical Freight 326199 Other Plastics Products High volume, varied customers Plastic components, products 326111 Plastics Bag & Pouch Mfg Consumer goods, retail distribution Bags to retailers, food co's 326113 Unlaminated Plastics Film Packaging materials, industrial Film to converters, packagers 326122 Plastics Pipe & Fitting Construction, consistent demand PVC to distributors, sites 326160 Plastics Bottle Mfg Beverage, consumer goods Bottles to bottlers, brands 322211 Corrugated Box Mfg Packaging, e-commerce boom Boxes to fulfillment, mfg 322212 Folding Paperboard Box Consumer goods packaging Packaging to brands 322219 Other Paperboard Container Industrial packaging Containers to manufacturers ZoomInfo Filters:  50-300 employees | $10M-$150M revenue | All target states 7.6 Target List 4: Automotive & JIT Manufacturing Companies serving automotive supply chains have the highest reliability requirements—and pay premium rates for performance. They cannot tolerate late deliveries. Why They Need Brokers (and Pay Premium Rates) – JIT manufacturing = zero tolerance for late deliveries – Production line shutdowns cost $10,000-50,000 per hour – Multiple tier suppliers need flexible overflow capacity – Will pay expedited rates when their regular carriers fail – Penalize suppliers for late delivery—they pass that pressure to logistics NAICS Codes NAICS Industry Why Good for Expedited Typical Freight 336310 Motor Vehicle Engines Critical components, high value Engines to assembly plants 336350 Transmission & Powertrain High-value, JIT critical Transmissions to OEMs 336360 Seating & Interior Trim Direct to assembly line Seats, trim to plants 336370 Metal Stamping High volume, consistent Stamped parts to Tier 1s 336390 Other Motor Vehicle Parts Tier 1-2 suppliers Various components 336211 Motor Vehicle Bodies Heavy, regional shipments Bodies, frames 333415 HVAC Equipment Mfg Breakdown replacements urgent HVAC units, parts ZoomInfo Filters:  100-750 employees | $25M-$400M revenue | MI, OH, IN, TN, AL, SC (auto manufacturing corridor) 7.7 List Allocation Strategy How to divide 1,500 contacts/month across the four target lists: List Allocation Contacts/Month Rationale Building Products 25% ~375 Heavy products, regional, good margins, construction demand Metal Fabrication 30% ~450 Broadest opportunity, relationship-based, loyal customers Plastics & Packaging 25% ~375 Consistent volume, repeat lanes, recession-resistant Automotive/JIT 20% ~300 Higher margin but stricter requirements, expedited potential Adjust monthly based on conversion data. If automotive converts 2x better than plastics, shift allocation. If building products respond better to cold email, increase that list. Let the data guide resource allocation. 7.8 Contact Quality Requirements A bad list wastes time and damages email deliverability. Every contact must meet these standards before import: Requirement How to Verify Why It Matters Direct phone number ZoomInfo filter—no main lines Patrick can't waste time with gatekeepers Corporate email only No Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. Personal emails bounce more, look unprofessional Fresh data (<6 months) Spot-check 20 contacts on LinkedIn ZoomInfo data decays 20-30% per year Job changer priority Filter: start date <12 months New managers 5x more open to new vendors Dedupe vs. HubSpot Export existing contacts, remove matches Don't waste outreach on existing contacts Remove competitors Exclude 'logistics', '3PL', 'trucking', 'freight' These are competitors, not prospects Company size verified Check employee count and revenue Avoid wasting time on too-small or too-large 7.9 Monthly List Hygiene Keep lists healthy with monthly maintenance: – Remove bounced emails immediately (damages sender reputation) – Remove unsubscribes immediately (legal requirement) – Tag engaged contacts (opened 2+ emails) for priority follow-up – Tag non-responsive contacts (0 opens after full sequence) for removal – Refresh job changers monthly (new hires at existing target companies) Part 8: HubSpot Pipeline Configuration 8.1 Deal Stages Every prospect moves through these stages. Each stage has clear entry criteria, exit actions, and time limits: Stage Definition Exit Criteria Max Days 1. New Lead Contact identified, not yet engaged First outreach attempt made 2 2. Contacted Outreach attempted (call/email) Had actual conversation with DM 14 3. Engaged Two-way conversation occurred Freight needs qualified 7 4. Qualified Has freight, authority, timeline Rate quote sent 7 5. Quote Sent Pricing delivered to prospect Follow-up completed, decision pending 14 6. Negotiating Active discussion on terms/rates Agreement on terms reached 14 7. First Load Booked Trial shipment scheduled First load delivered successfully 14 8. Won – Active Customer Repeat business confirmed Handoff to David complete — Deals stuck past their max days trigger review in weekly sales meeting. Stage movement requires evidence (logged call, email, quote) in HubSpot—no phantom progress. 8.2 Required Contact Properties Property Type Purpose Lead Source Dropdown Track which channels produce best customers ZoomInfo List Dropdown Identify which industry targeting works best Estimated Monthly Loads Number Size the opportunity Primary Lanes Text Match with carrier capacity, identify patterns Current Provider Text Know the competition, understand switching risk Decision Timeline Date Prioritize pipeline work Authority Level Dropdown DM, Influencer, User, Unknown Next Action Text Drive daily priorities Next Action Date Date Ensure follow-through 8.3 Lost Deal Tracking When deals are lost, capture why. This informs strategy: Lost Reason What It Tells Us Price too high May need to adjust pricing or better qualify budget upfront Went with competitor What did they offer that we didn't? No decision / went dark Better qualification or follow-up needed Timing not right Recycle in 90 days, keep warm Bad fit / wrong target Adjust lead targeting Service concerns Address in pitch, improve case studies Part 9: Operations System 9.1 David's Role and Success Definition David is the operational backbone of BlackBridge. Every load, carrier relationship, and customer update flows through him. When David succeeds, customers say "we never have to worry about our freight." Success Metrics for David Metric Target Why It Matters How to Measure On-Time Pickup >95% First impression with carrier/customer Alvys + Trucker Tools tracking On-Time Delivery >95% Customers judge reliability on delivery Alvys + Trucker Tools tracking Issue Resolution Time <2 hrs critical, <4 hrs standard Speed defines service quality Timestamp logging in Alvys Direct Carrier % >35% Q2, >50% Q4 Better margins and reliability Carrier tagging at booking Repeat Carrier Rate Track and grow Good carriers = good service Carrier ID tracking Customer Complaints <2% of loads Measures overall service quality HubSpot or separate log How to Track Issue Resolution Time When an issue occurs (late truck, no-show, damage, customer complaint), David logs in Alvys notes: – ISSUE [timestamp]: Brief description of problem (e.g., 'Carrier 2 hrs late to pickup') – RESOLVED [timestamp]: How it was fixed (e.g., 'Customer notified, delivery window extended') Weekly: Calculate average time between ISSUE and RESOLVED timestamps. Monthly: Review in ops meeting, identify patterns. 9.2 Daily Workflow Priorities Operations is inherently reactive—fires come up and need immediate attention. This is a priority framework that tells David where to focus when he has discretionary time: Priority 1: Active Load Management (Always First) – Monitor all in-transit loads via Trucker Tools and Alvys – Respond to customer inquiries immediately – Resolve issues—this takes precedence over everything else – Proactive check-ins with carriers on hot loads Priority 2: Load Booking and Dispatch (Second) – Book new loads from existing customers – Source carriers—check preferred list first, then load boards – Confirm appointments, verify carrier compliance – Update tracking information Priority 3: Carrier Development (When Possible) – Build relationships with good performing carriers – Source direct carriers for high-volume lanes – Update carrier performance ratings – Identify candidates for preferred tier promotion FLEXIBILITY PRINCIPLE David needs flexibility to put out fires. The priority framework ensures that when he has discretionary time, he knows where to focus—but active loads always come first. If three fires are burning, David handles them. If nothing is on fire, he books loads. If loads are covered, he develops carriers. 9.3 Load Booking: The Handoff The handoff from sales to operations is where margin gets protected or destroyed. A clean handoff = fewer touches = better margin = better customer experience. The Problems We're Solving – Patrick's time is expensive—every minute on ops is a minute not selling – Multiple handoffs create confusion and dropped balls – Customer doesn't know who to call = poor experience – Shared responsibility means no one is truly accountable Who Books What Scenario Who Books Why New customer's FIRST load Patrick He made the promise, he delivers on it. Customer trust transfers with successful first load. New customer's SECOND+ loads David Handoff complete after first success. David owns all ongoing operations. Existing customer's loads David He owns the relationship operationally. No exceptions. Urgent same-day from new prospect Patrick directly Can't wait—speed wins the trial. Patrick books it immediately. High-value strategic load (new) Patrick + David together Critical loads where relationship + execution both matter. The Clean Handoff Process (After First Load Delivers) 1.  Patrick books and monitors the first load personally 2.  Patrick confirms first load delivered successfully 3.  Patrick sends intro email to customer: "David will be your day-to-day contact going forward. He knows your lanes and will take great care of you." 4.  Patrick CCs David on the email 5.  David takes over ALL future booking, tracking, and communication 6.  Patrick stays available for relationship escalations ONLY (David handles 95%+ on his own) 7.  Customer profile and preferences documented in HubSpot before handoff WHY THIS MATTERS FOR MARGIN Margin Optimization: Patrick's time costs money—every hour on ops is an hour not closing deals worth $15K+ in annual margin. Clean Experience: Customer has ONE ops contact, not handoff confusion. They always know who to call. Speed: David handles volume without waiting for Patrick's availability. David can book while Patrick is on sales calls. Fewer Touches: One person owns it = fewer communication gaps = fewer mistakes = better service = repeat business. Handling the Bottleneck Risk If Patrick has too many first loads to book personally, it creates a bottleneck. Solutions: – Patrick books his own first loads—can't wait for David's availability – David focuses exclusively on existing customer volume – At 150+ loads/month, hire ops support to free David for carrier development – If Patrick is closing 6+ customers/month, the bottleneck triggers faster hiring 9.4 Load Execution Checklist (Draft for David Review) NOTE This is a rough outline requiring David's review and sign-off. The actual process should reflect how David works best. He knows the operational reality better than any document. Pre-Dispatch – Confirm load details match customer request (weight, dims, commodity, dates) – Check for special requirements (temperature, hazmat, appointment times) – Source carrier—check preferred list first, then proven, then load boards – Verify carrier authority, insurance, safety rating – Confirm rate, pickup/delivery times with carrier – Send rate confirmation to carrier – Update Alvys with carrier info, tracking setup In-Transit (Trucker Tools Active) – Confirm pickup completed, get any reference numbers – Track via Trucker Tools—verify location updates – Proactive check-ins at key milestones for high-value loads – Alert customer proactively if any delays (don't wait for them to ask) – Document any issues immediately (ISSUE timestamp in notes) Post-Delivery – Confirm delivery completed, get signed POD – Close load in Alvys, update all tracking info – Rate carrier performance (on-time, communication, issues) – Flag good carriers for preferred list consideration – Document any issues and resolution (RESOLVED timestamp in notes) – Invoice customer per agreed terms 9.5 Escalation Paths Clear escalation paths prevent bottlenecks and ensure issues get resolved at the right level: Issue Type First Response Escalate To Final Authority Late pickup/delivery David Vin Vin Carrier no-show David Vin Vin Customer complaint (service) David Vin → Chris Chris Customer complaint (relationship) David Chris Chris Cargo damage/claim David Vin Jason Payment/collections (carrier) David Vin Vin Payment/collections (customer) David Vin Jason ESCALATION PRINCIPLE David and Vin handle 95% of operational issues without involving anyone else. Chris gets involved only when customer relationships are at risk. Jason is involved only for cargo damage/claims and customer payment/collections issues—not routine operations. Part 10: Carrier Development Strategy 10.1 Current State: What We Need to Track We don't currently have clean data on our carrier mix. To build a real strategy, we need to start tracking. Starting in February, David tags every load with carrier type: Metric What It Tells Us How to Track Spot Carrier % Loads booked from load boards (DAT, Truckstop) Tag 'SPOT' in Alvys at booking Repeat Carrier % Carriers we've used 3+ times Tag 'REPEAT' in Alvys at booking Direct Carrier % Relationship carriers (not from boards) Tag 'DIRECT' in Alvys at booking Carrier Performance On-time %, issues, reliability Post-load rating in Alvys After 60 days of tracking, we'll have baseline data to set meaningful targets. Preliminary targets (subject to adjustment based on baseline): – Spot Carrier % < 40% by Q4 (currently unknown, likely 60-70%) – Direct Carrier % > 35% by Q2, > 50% by Q4 10.2 Building Direct Carrier Relationships Goal: Build a network of carriers who want to haul for BlackBridge regularly because we pay fairly, communicate clearly, and treat them with respect. Where to Find Direct Carriers – Convert performing spot carriers: When a spot carrier does great work, call them after delivery. Ask if they'd like regular loads on that lane. – Outbound calls to carriers in key lanes: Identify our high-volume lanes, find carriers who run those lanes regularly. – Referrals from existing carriers: Good carriers know other good carriers. Ask for introductions. – Carrier database mining: Review historical Alvys data for carriers with good performance who we haven't used recently. What Carriers Want What They Want How We Deliver Quick pay (faster than 30 days) Offer quick pay options where margin allows Consistent freight Build lane density, offer volume commitments Fair rates (not lowest, but fair) Don't squeeze every dollar—relationship matters Professional communication Clear load details, responsive to questions Respect for their time Accurate appointment times, no excessive detention Honest expectations Don't overpromise load frequency or rates 10.3 Carrier Outreach Framework SCRIPT STATUS The carrier outreach script needs to be developed as a team and continuously measured and improved. Like sales scripts, this should be version-controlled with regular reviews. David and Vin should refine based on what works. Initial Outreach Call (to convert spot carriers) "Hi [Driver/Dispatcher], this is David at BlackBridge. You hauled a load for us last week from [origin] to [destination] and our customer was really happy with your service. We have regular freight on that lane—any interest in getting more loads from us?" 10.4 Carrier Tiers and Tracking Categorize carriers by performance. This should be visible in the dashboard for weekly review: Tier Criteria Treatment Action Preferred 5+ loads, <2% issues, reliable communication First call for matching lanes, best rates we can offer Maintain relationship, check in monthly Proven 3-5 loads, consistent performance Regular consideration for loads Track for promotion to Preferred Trial 1-2 loads, evaluating Monitor closely, detailed feedback Decision point: promote or remove Do Not Use Major issues, safety concerns, no-shows Blocked in system, no exceptions Document reason, review quarterly Dashboard view should show: List of Preferred and Proven carriers by lane, load count, and performance rating. Updated weekly by David. Part 11: Financial Model 11.1 Base Assumptions Variable Assumption Source/Rationale Average Margin per Load $208 Historical data from 774 loads Average Loads per Customer (Month 6+) 15-20 Based on existing customer patterns Annual Churn Rate 15-20% Industry standard for 3PL Sales Rep Capacity 4-6 new customers/month Assumes 200 dials/week, good list Ops Capacity (David alone) ~150 loads/month Before needing support New Rep Ramp Time 60-90 days to productivity Standard for freight sales 11.2 Scenario 1: Patrick Only (No New Hires) What happens if Patrick alone executes perfectly with no additional sales hires? Month New Customers Total Active Est. Loads Gross Margin Est. Net Profit Jan 2 9 75 $15,600 $12,000 Feb 4 13 95 $19,760 $15,000 Mar 5 17 120 $24,960 $19,000 Apr 5 21 155 $32,240 $25,000 May 5 25 185 $38,480 $30,000 Jun 5 29 230 $47,840 $38,000 Jul 5 33 275 $57,200 $45,000 Aug 5 37 315 $65,520 $52,000 Sep 5 40 345 $71,760 $57,000 Oct 5 43 375 $78,000 $62,000 Nov 5 46 400 $83,200 $66,000 Dec 5 48 420 $87,360 $69,000 SCENARIO 1 RESULT With Patrick alone at perfect execution: ~$69K monthly profit by December. This MISSES the $100K target by approximately $31K. And this assumes zero bad months, zero churn above baseline, and Patrick maintaining 5 customers/month for 12 straight months—unrealistic. Actual result likely $55K-65K. 11.3 Scenario 2: With Planned Hires What happens if we hire based on performance triggers (Rep #2 in May, Rep #3 in August, Ops Support in June)?

SCENARIO 2 RESULT With performance-triggered hires: $102K monthly profit by December with buffer for churn and execution variance. The investment in additional sales capacity pays for itself within 60-90 days of each hire reaching productivity. 11.4 Break-Even Analysis for Hires Hire Monthly Cost Break-Even Production Target Production Payback Period Sales Rep #2 $6,000 3 customers/month 4-5 customers/month 60 days after ramp Sales Rep #3 $6,000 3 customers/month 4-5 customers/month 60 days after ramp Ops Coordinator $3,500 Support 60+ loads Support 100+ loads Immediate (enables scale) Part 12: KPIs and Dashboard These KPIs will be tracked in an online dashboard that the entire team can access. The dashboard is the single source of truth—no more digging through spreadsheets or relying on memory. DASHBOARD PURPOSE The dashboard exists so every meeting starts with data, not opinions. When something is off-track, we see it immediately. When we're winning, we can celebrate with evidence. It drives accountability and enables faster, better decisions. 12.1 Sales KPIs Metric Target Frequency How to Measure Owner Dials 200/week per rep Daily HubSpot call logging Patrick/Chris Conversations 35-40/week Daily HubSpot calls with notes Patrick/Chris Qualified Prospects 8-10/week Weekly Deals in Qualified stage Chris New Customers 4-6/month Monthly Deals moved to Won Chris Pipeline Value Growing Weekly HubSpot pipeline report Chris Email Reply Rate >3% Weekly Instantly.ai dashboard Patrick Quote-to-Close Rate >40% Monthly HubSpot stage conversion Chris 12.2 Operations KPIs Metric Target Frequency How to Measure Owner On-Time Pickup >95% Weekly Alvys + Trucker Tools David/Vin On-Time Delivery >95% Weekly Alvys + Trucker Tools David/Vin Margin per Load >$200 Weekly Alvys margin report Vin Issue Resolution Time <2 hrs critical Weekly Alvys note timestamps David/Vin Direct Carrier % >35% Q2, >50% Q4 Monthly Carrier tagging in Alvys David/Vin Repeat Carrier Rate Track and grow Monthly Carrier ID analysis David/Vin Customer Complaints <2% of loads Monthly HubSpot or separate log Vin 12.3 Business KPIs Metric Target Frequency How to Measure Owner Monthly Gross Margin Growing → $100K Monthly Alvys + accounting Jason Monthly Net Profit Growing → $100K Monthly P&L Jason Active Customers Growing → 65-70 Monthly HubSpot + Alvys Chris Customer Churn Rate <15% annual Quarterly Customer retention analysis Chris Customer Concentration No customer >15% Monthly By-customer margin report Jason Average Loads per Customer Growing → 15-20 Monthly Alvys by-customer report Vin 12.4 Dashboard Implementation Recommended approach for building the dashboard: Option Cost Pros Cons HubSpot Dashboards Free (included) Sales data native, easy setup Ops data needs manual entry Google Sheets + Looker Studio Free Flexible, can combine sources Requires manual data sync Databox $50-100/month Professional, combines sources Monthly cost Custom Build Variable Exactly what you want Time investment, maintenance Recommendation:  Start with HubSpot dashboards for sales metrics + a Google Sheet for ops metrics.

Every action has an owner and a deadline. The next 30 days establish the foundation—if we don't get this right, nothing else in the plan matters. Week 1 (Jan 20-24): Role Separation and Foundation Action Owner Deadline Success Criteria Document all ops tasks Patrick currently handles Patrick + David Jan 22 Written list reviewed by Vin Transfer customer communication ownership to David Patrick Jan 24 All existing customers notified of David as contact Set up protected calling blocks in Patrick's calendar Patrick + Chris Jan 22 Calendar shows three blocks daily, shared with team Patrick begins logging all calls in HubSpot Patrick Jan 22 Every call logged with outcome and notes David confirms ownership of all active loads David Jan 24 No loads assigned to Patrick in Alvys Week 2 (Jan 27-31): Sales Ramp + Email Setup Action Owner Deadline Success Criteria Patrick hits 30+ dials/day average Patrick/Chris Jan 31 150+ dials logged for the week Purchase 3 secondary domains for Instantly.ai Jason Jan 28 Domains registered, DNS configured Set up Instantly.ai account and begin warmup Jason/Patrick Jan 29 Warmup running on all 9 email addresses Pull first 2,000 contacts from ZoomInfo Patrick Jan 30 Contacts imported to HubSpot + Instantly.ai HubSpot deal stages configured Chris Jan 31 All 8 stages active, ready for use First Wednesday company meeting held All Jan 29 Agenda followed, dashboard discussed Week 3 (Feb 3-7): Full Activity + Email Launch Action Owner Deadline Success Criteria Patrick hits 40+ dials/day Patrick/Chris Feb 7 200+ dials logged for the week Begin Instantly.ai sending (20% volume) Patrick Feb 5 First emails out, tracking deliverability First 1-2 new customers closed Patrick Feb 7 Deals in HubSpot at Won stage Begin carrier type tagging in Alvys David Feb 7 Every new load tagged spot/repeat/direct First weekly sales review meeting Chris/Patrick Feb 4 Agenda followed, documented outcomes First weekly ops review meeting Vin/David Feb 6 Agenda followed, documented outcomes Week 4 (Feb 10-14): Validate and Adjust Action Owner Deadline Success Criteria Patrick sustained at 200 dials/week Patrick/Chris Feb 14 Two consecutive weeks at target Instantly.ai at 50% sending velocity Patrick Feb 14 ~2,500 emails/week, replies coming in Review and refine call scripts based on results Chris/Patrick Feb 12 Version 1.1 documented with improvements 2-3 new customers closed for January Patrick Feb 14 Deals in Won stage, first loads scheduled KPI dashboard v1.0 live Jason Feb 14 Team can see key metrics First monthly ownership review Jason/Vin/Chris Feb 14 February plan confirmed, adjustments made DAY 30 SUCCESS CRITERIA Patrick: 600+ dials logged, 80+ conversations, 20+ qualified prospects, 2-4 new customers closed | David: 100% ops ownership, carrier tagging implemented, no loads assigned to Patrick | Instantly.ai: Warmup complete, sending at 50%+ velocity | HubSpot: Pipeline tracking live with all deals in stages | All meetings: Running on schedule with documented outcomes Summary: What Must Be True The entire plan hinges on a few critical assumptions. If any of these prove false, the plan needs to adapt. Core Assumptions – Patrick can sustain 200+ dials/week when freed from ops. If not, we have a capacity or fit problem. Test this in weeks 3-6. – David can handle full ops load with 150+ loads/month before needing support. If he hits capacity earlier, we hire ops support sooner. – Cold email will generate 2-4% reply rate with quality list and copy. If deliverability is an issue, we'll know by week 6 and can adjust. – $208/load margin is maintainable at scale. If margins compress as we grow, we need better carrier development or pricing adjustments. – 4-6 new customers/month is achievable with consistent activity. If conversion rates are lower than expected, we adjust targeting before adding more activity. – Hiring accelerates growth faster than cost. Each sales rep should generate 40-60x their cost in customer value. If not, we've hired wrong. The Sequence Matters These priorities are in order. Don't skip ahead: 1.  Get Patrick making 40 dials/day. Everything else depends on this. Do not launch email, do not hire, do not build dashboards until the sales engine is running. 2.  Give David full ownership of operations. No shared responsibilities that create confusion. Clean handoffs, clear accountability. 3.  Launch Instantly.ai by mid-February. This multiplies Patrick's effectiveness and creates warm leads. 4.  Track everything from day one. Dashboard visibility drives accountability and enables better decisions. 5.  Hire based on proven performance, not hope. Each hire is triggered by demonstrated results. 6.  Scale what works. Kill what doesn't. Adapt constantly based on data. THE BOTTOM LINE This plan gets BlackBridge from $12K to $100K monthly net profit by December 2026. It requires consistent execution on sales activity, clean role separation, smart use of email automation, and disciplined hiring. The math works. The question is whether we execute. This plan is a roadmap, not a script. The goal is to create enough structure to know whether you're winning or losing, and enough flexibility to adapt when you learn something new. Good luck. — BlackBridge Logistics 2026 Growth Plan — Data: 880 loads from Alvys | 774 with complete margin data | January 2026
