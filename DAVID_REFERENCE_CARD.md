# David's Role & Commitments
## 2026 Growth Strategy Reference Card

---

## Your Role

**Operations Excellence** — You are the backbone. Without you, sales promises mean nothing.

---

## What You Own

| Area | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **All Load Execution** | After handoff, you own every load |
| **Carrier Relationships** | Building and maintaining carrier network |
| **Customer Communication** | Day-to-day updates and issue resolution |
| **Process Improvement** | You set the priorities, you own the playbook |
| **Your Schedule** | You control how you organize your work |

---

## What You Don't Own

- New customer acquisition → **Patrick**
- Pricing decisions → **Chris**
- Sales calls or prospecting → **Patrick**
- Strategic carrier negotiations → **Vin supports**

---

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **On-Time Delivery** | 95%+ | Primary quality metric |
| **Carrier Retention** | 80%+ | Keep good carriers coming back |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | 90%+ | Measured by repeat business |
| **Issue Resolution** | Same-day | Escalate if blocked |

---

## Your Domain

You have **complete ownership of day-to-day operations**.

This means:
- You decide how to prioritize loads
- You decide which carriers to use
- You decide how to communicate with customers
- You decide when to escalate vs. handle yourself

Patrick and leadership don't tell you how to run ops. You tell us what you need.

---

## Your Support System

**Vin (Operations Lead)**
- Daily 15-minute sync
- 1-hour escalation response during business hours
- Strategic support on carrier negotiations
- Shield from non-essential requests

**When to Escalate to Vin:**
- Carrier issue you can't resolve
- Customer escalation beyond your authority
- Need strategic guidance on a decision
- Volume is approaching capacity limits

---

## The Support Promise

**Help arrives BEFORE you drown.**

| Load Volume | What Happens |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Current - 100/month** | You handle solo with Vin support |
| **100-120/month** | We start ops coordinator search |
| **120/month** | Ops coordinator hire initiated |
| **150/month** | Ops coordinator should be onboarded |

We will NOT wait until you're burned out to hire help. The trigger is 120 loads/month, not "David looks tired."

---

## Handoff Protocol (Receiving from Patrick)

When Patrick hands off a new customer:

1. **Patrick books and monitors first load** — He delivers on his promise
2. **Patrick sends intro email, CCs you** — You're now their contact
3. **You take over ALL future operations** — No going back to Patrick
4. **Review customer profile in HubSpot** — Understand their preferences
5. **Introduce yourself personally** — Build your own relationship
6. **Handle 95%+ independently** — Only escalate true relationship issues

---

## Priority Framework

When demands compete, use this order:

1. **Active loads in transit** — Real-time issues first
2. **Today's pickups** — Get them moving
3. **Customer communications** — Keep them informed
4. **Carrier confirmations** — Secure tomorrow's capacity
5. **Administrative tasks** — Process improvements

---

## Growth Path

| Now | Milestone | Future |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Operations | 150+ loads/month | + Ops Coordinator |
| Operations | 200+ loads/month | Operations Manager |

You're building the ops playbook that scales. Your fingerprints will be on the system we use for years.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By December 2026:
- You're managing 200+ loads/month
- You have an ops coordinator supporting you
- The ops playbook you built is documented
- You're the Operations Manager

---

## If You're Struggling

**What happens if volume spikes unexpectedly?**

Escalate to Vin immediately. We'll find coverage or adjust expectations with customers. You don't suffer in silence.

**What happens if a carrier repeatedly fails?**

Document it, escalate to Vin, and we'll address it strategically. You have authority to blacklist carriers for cause.

**What happens if Patrick keeps asking for ops help?**

Say no. Escalate to Vin or Jason. We committed to protecting your domain. Patrick's job is sales, not asking you for favors.

---

## Key Contacts

| Person | Role | When to Contact |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Vin** | Operations Lead | Daily sync, escalations, strategic issues |
| **Patrick** | Sales | Only for relationship-critical customer issues |
| **Jason** | President | Blocked decisions, capital needs |

---

## Remember

Sales can only succeed because operations delivers. Patrick can make all the promises in the world — you're the one who makes them real.

You're not support for sales. You're the backbone of the business.
