# BlackBridge Logistics: The Year We Go From Good to Great

**Pre-Read Document for 2026 Growth Strategy Session**

---

## What This Document Is

This is a 5-minute read to prepare you for our strategy session. We're sharing it ahead of time because we want you thinking, not just listening.

---

## The Foundation You Built

Over the past two years, Patrick and David have built something real:

- **774 loads delivered** — real freight, real customers, real execution
- **$160,000 in gross margin** — profitable business, not speculative volume
- **$200+ profit per load** — unit economics that work at scale
- **7 active customers** — relationships built through trust and delivery

This isn't a startup pitch. This is a business that works. You proved it.

---

## What We Got Wrong

Here's where we need to own our mistakes:

**We asked Patrick to do the impossible.** Running sales AND operations isn't a stretch goal — it's structurally impossible. When a carrier issue hits, operations wins. Always. That's physics, not failure.

**We made David invisible.** Every conversation was about sales, but sales means nothing without operations. David's been carrying load execution without the recognition he deserves.

**We measured results without fixing the structure.** We tracked numbers but didn't solve the root cause. We asked for more output without giving you the structure to produce it.

---

## The Structural Change

One change unlocks everything:

**Patrick owns sales. David owns operations.**

Clear handoff. No overlap. No competing priorities.

This isn't about working harder. It's about working differently.

---

## What This Means for Patrick

- **Protected calling time:** 8am-12pm daily, no interruptions, no exceptions
- **Clear targets:** 200 calls/week → 40 conversations → 4 quotes → 4 new customers/month
- **Growth path:** Prove the system works, and there's a Sales Lead role as the team grows
- **Support:** Chris available for coaching and deal support on demand

**What you won't do anymore:** Day-to-day operations after handoff. That's David's domain.

---

## What This Means for David

- **Complete ownership:** All post-handoff operations are yours to run
- **Your process:** You set the priorities, you own the carrier relationships
- **Support before burnout:** Ops coordinator hire triggers at 120 loads/month — before you're drowning, not after
- **Growth path:** Operations Manager with your own team as volume scales

**What you won't do anymore:** Get pulled into sales or prospecting. That's Patrick's domain.

---

## What Leadership Commits To

We're not just asking you to change. Here's what we commit:

**Chris:**
- Weekly 1:1 coaching with Patrick
- Available for deal support within 2 hours
- Joint calls on deals over $500/month margin

**Vin:**
- Daily 15-minute sync with David
- Initiate ops coordinator hire BEFORE 120 loads/month
- 1-hour escalation response during business hours

**Jason:**
- Technology support and decisions within 48 hours
- Capital available when hiring triggers are met
- Will NOT pull Patrick into operations during protected time for any reason

---

## The Goal

By December 31, 2026:
- **65-70 customers** (from 7 today)
- **$100,000/month profit** (from $12,000 today)
- **4 sales reps** (from 1 today)
- **A proven, scalable system**

---

## What We're Asking

**90 days of commitment to this approach.**

If the data says we're wrong, we pivot together. No blame. Just adjustment.

In return, we commit to protecting your time, giving you the tools you need, and celebrating your wins publicly.

---

## Questions to Think About

Come to the session with your honest thoughts:

1. What concerns haven't we addressed?
2. What would make you feel more confident about this approach?
3. What do you need from us that isn't in this document?

---

## The Session Format

- **60 minutes:** We'll walk through the full strategy, including specifics on systems, targets, and support
- **30+ minutes:** Open discussion — your questions, your concerns, your input
- **After:** You'll have full access to the presentation to review independently

---

*This isn't a plan being done TO you. It's a plan we need to do WITH you.*

---

**See you at the session.**

— Jason, Chris, and Vin
