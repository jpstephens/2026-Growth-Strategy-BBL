## Session Flow

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Facilitator:** Jason

"Thank you for making time for this. Before we start, I want to be clear about what this is and isn't.

This is not a performance review. This is not a lecture. This is a working session.

We've spent time analyzing what's working, what's not, and what needs to change. But this plan only works if you believe in it. Your input today will shape the final version.

Let's begin."

---

### Act 1: Recognition (10 minutes)
**Slides 1-5**

**Purpose:** Make Patrick and David feel valued

**Key Messages:**
- You built something real
- 774 loads, $160K margin is YOUR accomplishment
- We're scaling what you created

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Make eye contact with Patrick and David
- Let the numbers speak — don't over-explain
- Watch for reactions — are they engaged?

---

### Act 2: Ownership (10 minutes)
**Slides 6-10**

**Purpose:** Take responsibility for structural failures

**Key Messages:**
- WE got the structure wrong
- Patrick was set up to fail
- Roles blurred together, preventing focus
- The problem is structural, not personal

**Facilitator Notes:**
- This is the hardest part to deliver authentically
- Don't rush through it
- Use "we" language consistently
- Watch Patrick's face during "impossible math"

**Discussion Pause (Optional):**
"Patrick, does this match your experience? What would you add?"

---

### Act 3: Vision (10 minutes)
**Slides 11-15**

**Purpose:** Get excited about what's possible

**Key Messages:**
- Here's the goal: $100K/month profit
- Here's what Patrick's life looks like with focus
- Here's what David's life looks like with support
- There's a career path for both of you

**Facilitator Notes:**
- This should feel energizing, not pressuring
- Paint the picture of December 2026
- Emphasize THEIR growth paths

---

### Act 4: Solution (15 minutes)
**Slides 16-23**

**Purpose:** Show the specific changes

**Key Messages:**
- Three structural changes
- Clear role separation
- Protected calling time
- Handoff protocol

**Discussion Pause:**
"Patrick, does this protected time structure work for you? What concerns do you have?"
"David, does the handoff protocol make sense? What would you change?"

---

### Act 5: Support System (12 minutes)
**Slides 24-35**

**Purpose:** Build trust that they'll be supported

**Key Messages:**
- Leadership has specific commitments
- Support arrives BEFORE burnout
- We're measured too, not just you

**Facilitator Notes:**
- The leadership commits slide should be delivered by each leader personally
- Chris states his commitments
- Vin states his commitments
- Jason states his commitments

**Discussion Pause:**
"What else do you need to feel set up to succeed?"

---

### Act 6: Roadmap (10 minutes)

### Act 7: Commitment (10 minutes)
**Slides 45-50**

**Purpose:** Partnership and shared ownership

**Key Messages:**
- Mutual commitments (not one-sided demands)
- 90-day commitment ask
- Questions you have (proactive answers)
- Final call to action

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Slow down for the final slide
- Don't rush the closing
- Transition smoothly into discussion

---

## Open Discussion (30+ minutes)

### Starting the Discussion

"Before we ask for your commitment, we want to hear from you.

Patrick — what concerns do you have that we haven't addressed?
David — what questions are on your mind?

There are no wrong answers here. This plan only works if you believe in it."

### Questions to Have Ready

**If Patrick is quiet:**
- "Patrick, what would make you more confident about the 200 calls/week target?"
- "What has pulled you into operations most frequently? How do we prevent that?"

**If David is quiet:**
- "David, at what point do you think you'd need help with volume?"
- "What do you need from Vin to feel fully supported?"

**If they express doubt:**
- "That's a fair concern. Let's talk through it."
- "What would we need to do differently to address that?"

**If they raise something we missed:**
- "Thank you for raising that. Let's add it to the plan."
- Take notes visibly — show you're listening

### Handling Pushback

**If Patrick says "200 calls is unrealistic":**
"Let's work through it. What number feels achievable with protected time? Let's start there and adjust based on data."

**If David says "I don't trust the ops hire will happen":**
"That's fair — we haven't earned that trust yet. What if we put it in writing? At 120 loads, the job is posted. You hold us to it."

**If either says "This feels like more pressure":**
"That's the opposite of what we want. Help us understand what would make this feel like support, not pressure."

## Closing (5 minutes)

**Facilitator:** Jason

"Thank you for your honest input today. Here's what happens next:

1. We'll update the plan based on what we discussed
2. You'll each get your reference card with your commitments and ours
3. You'll have access to this presentation to review anytime
4. We start executing Monday

One final question: What do you need from us to say yes to this approach?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

| Signal | What It Might Mean | Response |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Arms crossed, leaning back | Defensive, not bought in | Pause, ask what's on their mind |
| Looking at phone | Disengaged | Call it out gently, re-engage |
| Nodding but no questions | Going along without real buy-in | Ask directly: "What concerns aren't you voicing?" |
| Attacking the plan details | Engagement (good sign) | Listen, acknowledge, adapt |
| Complete silence | Processing or shut down | Give space, then ask open-ended questions |

---

## Success Criteria

The meeting is successful if:

- [ ] Patrick and David asked questions
- [ ] They voiced at least one concern (means they're thinking)
- [ ] They made eye contact and engaged
- [ ] They agreed to 90-day commitment
- [ ] They left with reference cards
- [ ] Follow-up is scheduled

---

## Key Reminders for Facilitators

1. **Listen more than you talk** during discussion
2. **Take notes visibly** — shows you're listening
3. **Don't get defensive** if they push back — that's engagement
4. **Use their names** — makes it personal
5. **Watch body language** — adjust if they're checking out
6. **End on partnership** — not demands

---

*The goal is buy-in, not compliance. If they leave feeling heard, respected, and supported, the plan will work. If they leave feeling lectured, it won't.*
