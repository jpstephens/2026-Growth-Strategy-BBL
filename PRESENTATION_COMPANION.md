# BlackBridge Logistics 2026 Growth Strategy
## Presentation Companion Guide

---

## The Goal
**December 2026 Target: $100,000 monthly net profit**

This requires:
- 65-70 active customers
- 4+ loads per customer per month
- $200+ margin per load
- 480+ loads monthly

---

## ACT 1: RECOGNITION (Slides 1-5)

### Current State
- 9 active customers
- 71 loads/month
- $15K monthly profit
- Clearway & Frontier = 44% of revenue (concentration risk)

### What We've Built
- Proven we can execute loads profitably
- Established key customer relationships
- Built operational foundation

---

## ACT 2: THE PROBLEM (Slides 6-9)

### What We Got Wrong
1. **No protected sales time** - Patrick pulled into ops constantly
2. **No clear handoff** - Confusion about who handles what
3. **Reactive mode** - Fighting fires instead of building

### The Incompatibility
Sales and operations require different mindsets:
- Sales: Future-focused, relationship building, outbound activity
- Operations: Present-focused, problem solving, service delivery

**One person cannot do both effectively.**

---

## ACT 3: THE VISION (Slides 10-14)

### Patrick's Role
- **100% sales focus**
- Protected calling time: 8am-12pm daily
- Target: 200+ dials/week, 4-5 new customers/month
- Owns: New customer acquisition, first load, handoff to David

### David's Role
- **100% operations focus**
- Owns: All load execution after handoff
- Owns: Carrier network development
- Owns: Day-to-day customer communication
- Target: 95%+ on-time, <2hr issue resolution

### Customer Ramp Model
| Month | Loads | Margin |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 1-2 | $200-400 |
| 2 | 4-6 | $800-1,200 |
| 3 | 8-12 | $1,600-2,400 |
| 6+ | 15-25 | $3,000-5,000 |

---

## ACT 4: THE SOLUTION (Slides 15-21)

### Three Key Changes
1. **Role Separation** - Patrick sells, David operates
2. **Protected Time** - 8am-12pm is sacred for sales
3. **Clear Handoff** - First load success, then David takes over

### Sales Funnel Math
**Weekly:**
- 200 dials
- 35 conversations (17.5% connect)
- 9 qualified (25% qualify)
- 4-5 customers (50% close)

**Monthly:**
- 800 dials
- 140 conversations
- 36 qualified
- 16-18 new customers

### Handoff Protocol
1. Patrick books and monitors first load personally
2. After successful first delivery, Patrick sends intro email to David
3. David takes over ALL future communication and booking
4. Customer profile documented in HubSpot
5. Patrick stays available for relationship escalations only

---

## ACT 5: THE SUPPORT SYSTEM (Slides 22-33)

### Leadership Commitments

- Initiate ops coordinator hire before 120 loads/month
- Escalation response within 1 hour

**Jason (President):**

### Carrier Tier System

## ACT 7: COMMITMENT (Slides 39-42)

### First 30 Days
**Week 1:**
- Patrick starts protected calling (8am-12pm)

**Week 2:**
- Patrick hits 200+ dials
- First handoff protocol executed
- Weekly metrics review begins

**Week 3-4:**
- First new customers closing
- Patterns emerging in data
- Adjustments being made

### Assumptions We're Making

|------------|--------|------------|
| Freight demand exists in target lanes | Verified | 85% |
| Margin stays above $200/load | Verified | 90% |
| Sales activity stays consistent | Dependent | 70% |
| David operates without interruptions | Verified | 85% |
| Churn stays below 5% monthly | External | 65% |
| No major customer loss | External | 75% |

### Key Risks & Mitigations
1. **Patrick doesn't sustain production**
   - Mitigation: Coaching from Chris, daily tracking, April 30 assessment

2. **Major customer loss**
   - Mitigation: Accelerate diversification to 65-70 customers

3. **David bottleneck at 150+ loads**
   - Mitigation: Ops Coordinator hired when >120 loads/month

4. **Margin compression**
   - Mitigation: Strict $200+ floor, monthly margin review
