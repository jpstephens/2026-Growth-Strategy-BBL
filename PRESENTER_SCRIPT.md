## ACT 1: RECOGNITION (Slides 1-5)
*Goal: Make Patrick and David feel SEEN and VALUED*

---

### SLIDE 1: Title - "Scaling What You Built"

**[OPEN WITH]**

"Before we dive in, I want to set the tone for this conversation. This presentation is called 'Scaling What You Built' for a reason.

Everything we're about to discuss—every projection, every target, every system—is built on the foundation that Patrick and David created together. We're not here to criticize or start over. We're here to take what's already working and scale it.

You can see the goal right here: from $11K in January to $100K by December. That's ambitious, but it's achievable—and I'll show you exactly how."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 2: Recognition - "What You've Built Together"

**[READ THE ROOM - This is important]**

"Before we talk about where we're going, I want to acknowledge what you've accomplished.

Look at these numbers: 819 loads delivered. $216K in gross margin. And going forward, we're targeting $208 profit per load—a conservative, achievable number.

Patrick—you built a reliable customer base with repeatable freight. Vibra Screw at $372 per load is the ideal customer profile. Frontier Door with 59 loads and $11K in margin shows what's possible when the relationship is right.

David—you executed 819 loads with minimal issues. You built carrier relationships that we can count on. You've saved customers through service recovery when things went sideways.

Here's the key message: You built a real business. $216K in margin isn't luck—it's execution. Everything we're planning next is built on this foundation."

**[PAUSE - Let this land]**

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 3: Executive Thesis - "You've Already Proven This Works"

**[BUILD THE CASE]**

"So what did you actually prove? Three things:

First, profitable unit economics. $208 target margin per load means this is a real business, not a charity.

Second, a repeatable sales process. When Patrick can focus, he converts. We've seen it.

Third, reliable operations. David executes consistently. Customers trust us.

So what's the gap? We have customers ready to buy. We have operations that work. The problem isn't the people—it's the structure.

The solution is simple: fix the structural constraint. Let Patrick sell. Let David run ops. Watch the numbers follow."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 4: Current State Metrics - "The Foundation: Proven Unit Economics"

**[SHOW THE DATA]**

"Let me show you the data that proves this model works.

819 loads analyzed from May 2024 through January 2026. $216K in gross margin. We're targeting $208 per load going forward. 19% margin rate.

Look at this chart—our margin per load has been consistently strong. This proves the model works. These are healthy, scalable unit economics."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 5: January Snapshot - "Our Starting Point"

**[ESTABLISH BASELINE]**

"Here's where we're starting from in January 2026.

71 loads. $125K in revenue. $11K in gross margin. 6 active customers.

Our top customer margins are solid—Vibra Screw at $372, Frontier Door at $191, ReWorld at $136. These prove the profile we're targeting.

The baseline is established. 6 active customers generating $11K margin in January. The model works—now we scale it."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

## ACT 2: OWNERSHIP (Slides 6-8)
*Goal: The SYSTEM failed them, not the other way around*

---

### SLIDE 6: The Problem - "How We Got Here"

**[BE EMPATHETIC - This is not blame]**

"Now let's talk about how we got here—and I want to be clear: this is not about pointing fingers. This is about understanding what happened so we can fix it.

As we grew organically, roles naturally blurred. That's normal for a startup. Patrick and David co-worked on everything—great for flexibility, but it prevented focus.

Here's what happened:
1. Roles blurred naturally
2. Ops always won the day—when a load needs coverage NOW, sales calls wait
3. No protected sales time—prospecting happened in stolen moments

Look at the impact: 0-50 calls per week when we need 200. About 1 new customer per month when we need 4-5. $11K monthly profit when we're targeting $100K.

The structure—not the effort—was the constraint.

What changes now? Patrick gets 100% sales focus. David owns all operations. Clear handoff protocol. Protected calling time. Support before burnout. And leadership enforces it."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 7: Why Incompatible - "Specialization Drives Productivity"

**[EXPLAIN THE 'WHY']**

"Let me explain why these two jobs can't be done by one person—it's not about capability, it's about the nature of the work.

Operations mode is reactive by nature. Carrier issues, customer updates, load tracking—these need immediate response. Success means handling many small tasks quickly. Context switching IS the job. When a load needs coverage NOW, everything else stops.

Sales mode is the opposite. It's proactive—outreach, follow-ups, relationship building require initiating, not responding. It needs deep focus blocks. 200 calls per week needs 4-hour uninterrupted sessions. Every interruption resets your momentum. Prospecting feels less urgent than ops fires, but it's what drives growth.

The opportunity: with clear boundaries, Patrick can make 200+ calls per week. David can own ops without distraction. Both become more productive—not because they work harder, but because the structure supports focus."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 8: The Math - "The Growth Trajectory"

**[SHOW THE PATH]**

"Here's the math on how we get from 9 customers to 65-70 by December.

This chart shows our customer growth trajectory. We need to add about 5 new customers per month on average. At 7.2 loads per customer and $208 margin per load, 68 customers delivering 481 loads per month equals $100K profit.

The foundation exists. The math works. Now we need the structure to execute it."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

## ACT 3: VISION (Slides 9-11)
*Goal: Excitement about what's POSSIBLE*

---

### SLIDE 9: The Goal - "By December 31, 2026"

**[PAINT THE PICTURE]**

"Here's what success looks like by December 31st.

65-70 customers. Diversification reduces risk—no single customer controls our future.

481 monthly loads. About 7 loads per customer average. Volume creates leverage with carriers.

$100K gross margin. At $200+ per load average. Proven unit economics at scale.

$80K+ net profit. After team costs. Sustainable growth that funds future hires.

This isn't aggressive growth. It's disciplined scaling of what already works—proven unit economics applied to more customers.

Look at this chart: from $11K to $100K. That's 9x growth in monthly profit. It's ambitious but achievable because we've already proven the model."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 10: Roles & Targets - "Patrick and David Side by Side"

**[MAKE IT PERSONAL]**

"Let's talk about what this means for each of you specifically.

**Patrick:** Your job is 100% sales focus. You own new customer acquisition, the first load relationship, and customer intro handoffs to David. Your targets: 200 dials per week, 4-5 new customers per month. Your protected calling time is 8am to 12pm daily—no meetings, no ops issues. Leadership enforces this boundary.

**David:** Your job is 100% operations focus. You own all load execution after handoff, carrier relationships, and day-to-day customer communication. Your targets: 95% on-time delivery, 90% customer satisfaction, 80% carrier retention. When you hit 120+ loads per month, we hire an ops coordinator—help arrives before burnout.

Clear handoff: Patrick books the first load, monitors it through successful delivery, then David takes over all future ops. One owner at each stage. No confusion."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 11: Customer Value Over Time

**[SHOW THE COMPOUNDING]**

"Here's how one customer grows in value over time—and why every new customer Patrick brings in matters.

Month 1-3: Building trust. 1-10 loads per month as they test us.
Month 4-6: Growing volume. 12-18 loads as they gain confidence.
Month 7+: Mature relationship. 20 loads per month consistently.

A fully ramped customer delivers $4,160 per month in margin.

On the right, you can see our customer profile tiers:
- Ideal: $300+ per load like Vibra Screw ($372/load)
- Target: $200+ per load, 10+ loads per month
- Volume play: $150-200 per load, but only if they do 15+ loads

What makes a customer ideal? $200+ margin, predictable volume, and low-maintenance. That's what we're targeting."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

## ACT 4: THE SOLUTION (Slides 12-17)
*Goal: Confidence that plan is SPECIFIC and ACHIEVABLE*

---

### SLIDE 12: Three Changes - "That Change Everything"

**[KEEP IT SIMPLE]**

"The plan comes down to three changes. Simple moves, big impact.

**Change 1: Free Patrick to Sell.** David takes 100% of operations. Patrick sells and only sells. No more context switching.

**Change 2: 200+ Calls Per Week.** 40 dials a day. No interruptions. Protected calling blocks daily. This is how you build a pipeline.

**Change 3: Warm + Cold Outreach.** 5,000 warm leads from Instantly.ai email campaigns, plus targeted cold calls. Multi-channel pipeline building.

How these work together: Change 1 makes 40+ dials per day possible. Change 2 generates 8-10 conversations per day. Change 3 improves connect rate to 15-20%.

The result: These three changes move Patrick from ~1 customer per month to 4-5 customers per month. That's the whole game."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 13: Team Structure

**[REVIEW BRIEFLY]**

"Here's the team structure. Jason handles strategy, technology, and capital allocation. Vin leads operations oversight and carrier strategy. Chris leads sales—he's Patrick's direct support for coaching and deal strategy. Patrick owns new customer acquisition. David owns load execution.

Clear lines. Clear accountability."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 14: Protected Calling

**[EMPHASIZE THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE]**

"This is critical: protected calling time. 8am to 12pm, Monday through Friday.

This is non-negotiable. No meetings during this time. No ops interruptions. If there's an emergency, David handles it or escalates to Chris or Vin—not Patrick.

Why? Because every interruption costs 20+ minutes of momentum. If Patrick gets interrupted 3 times in a morning, that's an hour of productive calling time gone. Multiply that across a week, and you lose an entire day of selling.

Leadership will enforce this boundary. Patrick, your job during those hours is to dial. Nothing else."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 15: Sales Activity Targets

**[SHOW THE FUNNEL MATH]**

"Here's the funnel math that shows how 200 dials per week becomes 4-5 new customers per month.

200 dials at 17.5% connect rate = 35 conversations.
35 conversations at 25% qualification rate = 9 qualified prospects.
9 qualified prospects at 50% close rate = 4-5 new customers.

Daily targets: 40+ dials, 8+ conversations.
Weekly: 200+ dials, 35+ conversations.
Monthly: 800 dials, 4-5 new customers.

This is proven sales math. It works across industries. Patrick has the skills—now he gets the structure to execute it."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 16: The Compound Effect

**[SHOW HOW IT BUILDS]**

"This chart shows the compound effect. Consistent activity feeds the pipeline. 4-5 customers per month compounds.

Look at this curve—by December, we're at 65-70 customers. Each customer grows in value over time. By December, each mature customer contributes $4K+ per month.

The flywheel:
1. Consistent activity: 200 dials per week, every week
2. Pipeline builds: Prospects move through stages
3. Customers close: 4-5 new per month
4. Value compounds: Each customer grows in margin

200 dials per week. 4-5 customers per month. 65-70 customers by December. $100K monthly profit."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 17: Handoff Protocol

**[MAKE IT CONCRETE]**

"Here's exactly how handoffs work between Patrick and David.

Step 1: Patrick books AND monitors the first load personally. He made the promise, he delivers on it.

Step 2: After successful first delivery, Patrick sends an intro email, CC'ing David.

Step 3: David takes over ALL future booking, tracking, and communication. One ops contact, no confusion.

Step 4: Patrick stays available for relationship escalations ONLY. David handles 95%+ on his own.

This protocol ensures clean transitions, no dropped balls, and Patrick can stay focused on the next sale."

**[ADVANCE]**

## ACT 5: THE SUPPORT SYSTEM (Slides 18-25)
*Goal: Trust that they'll be SET UP TO SUCCEED*

---

### SLIDE 18: Leadership Commits

**[MAKE YOUR COMMITMENT]**

"Now let me tell you what leadership commits to—because this isn't just about what we're asking of you.

**Chris commits to:** Weekly 1:1 coaching with Patrick. Available for deal support within 2 hours. Joint calls on any deal over $500/month margin. Handling pricing strategy so Patrick can focus on relationships.

**Vin commits to:** Daily 15-minute syncs with David. Initiating ops coordinator hire BEFORE David hits 120 loads. Escalation response within 1 hour. Shielding David from non-essential requests.

**I commit to:** Technology support and tool decisions within 48 hours. Capital available when hiring triggers are met. Strategic decisions within 48 hours. And critically—I will NOT pull Patrick into operations during protected time for ANY reason.

We're asking you to change. We're changing too."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 19: Lead Generation Strategy

**[SHOW THE SUPPORT]**

"You won't be cold calling into the void. Here's the lead generation support.

Email campaigns through Instantly.ai are warming up prospects before Patrick even dials. We're targeting 5,000+ contacts in our target verticals. By the time Patrick calls, many of them have already seen our name.

Combined with targeted cold outreach to specific NAICS codes, this creates a multi-channel approach that improves connect rates significantly."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 20: Target Verticals

**[QUICK OVERVIEW]**

"These are the four industries we're targeting—and why.

**Metal Fabrication (30%):** High-value components, JIT critical. $250+ per load. Sales tip: target quality managers—they pay for reliability.

**Building Products (25%):** Heavy, consistent, regional. $200+ per load. Sales tip: target purchasing and logistics coordinators.

**Industrial Equipment (25%):** Specialized handling, less competition. $250-400 per load. Sales tip: these customers value reliability over price—long-term accounts.

**Automotive JIT (20%):** Premium rates, time-critical. $300+ per load. Sales tip: start with Tier 1 and 2 suppliers near assembly plants.

Why these industries? Predictable freight, healthy margins, relationship-focused buyers who value service over price."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 21: Operations Priorities

**[DAVID'S ROADMAP]**

"David, here are your operations priorities.

Service quality first: 95%+ on-time delivery. This is what keeps customers coming back.

Carrier network: Building relationships with reliable carriers. Tracking performance. Preferring repeat carriers who know our lanes.

Process efficiency: Documenting what works so we can scale it. When we hire an ops coordinator, they inherit your playbook."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 22: Carrier Tiers

**[QUICK REVIEW]**

"We're building a tiered carrier network.

Tier 1: Our best carriers. Proven performance, first call on premium loads.
Tier 2: Reliable backups. Good performance, regular work.
Tier 3: Spot market. When we need capacity.

David owns carrier relationship development. Vin supports on strategy."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 23: Accountability

**[CLEAR OWNERSHIP]**

"Here's who owns what, so there's no confusion.

New customer acquisition: Patrick owns it. Chris supports with coaching.
Load execution quality: David owns it. Vin supports with escalation.
Sales team performance: Chris owns it.
Operations performance: Vin owns it.
Overall business results: I own it.

Clear accountability. No finger-pointing."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 24: Scaling Triggers

**[IMPORTANT - HIRING PLAN]**

"Can one person hit $100K monthly profit? Let's do the math.

Patrick alone tops out at $69K per month. Even with perfect execution—200 calls per week, 4-5 customers per month—one person has limits. We're short $31K.

Patrick plus two more reps hits $102K per month. 400+ calls per week combined, 8-10 new customers per month. That's how we hit the target.

So here are the hiring triggers—all performance-based:

**Sales Rep #2 (Q2):** Triggered when Patrick closes 4+ accounts per month for 2 consecutive months. Proves the system works. Cost: $6K/month.

**Ops Coordinator (Q2-Q3):** Triggered when David hits 120+ loads per month. Protects his capacity. Cost: $3.5K/month.

**Sales Rep #3 (Q3):** Triggered when Rep #2 reaches 3+ accounts per month. Proves the system scales. Cost: $6K/month.

**Sales Rep #4 (Q4):** Triggered when team hits 12+ combined accounts per month. Final push to target. Cost: $6K/month.

No speculative hiring. Patrick proves the system works first. Then we replicate."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 25: Financial Projection

**[SHOW THE NUMBERS]**

"Here's the financial projection showing how we get to $100K.

Month over month, as we add customers and they ramp up, margin grows. The compound effect kicks in around mid-year when our early customers hit full volume.

By December, 65-70 customers at average $4K per month each equals $100K+ in gross margin."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

## ACT 6: MEASUREMENT & ROADMAP (Slides 26-29)
*Goal: Clarity on WHAT HAPPENS WHEN*

---

### SLIDE 26: Sales & Operations KPIs

**[WHAT WE MEASURE]**

"What gets measured gets managed. Here are the primary KPIs we'll track.

**Sales:**
- 200 dials per week (Patrick, tracked daily)
- 4-5 new customers per month (Chris, monthly review)

**Operations:**
- 95%+ on-time delivery (David, weekly)
- $200+ margin per load (David, per load)

Secondary metrics include connect rates, pipeline stages, qualified prospects, and carrier performance.

All of this feeds into a custom dashboard. HubSpot API for sales activity. Alvys API for load data. Real-time updates. No manual tracking."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 27: Business KPIs

**[THE OUTCOMES]**

"These are the business outcomes we're driving toward.

$100K monthly gross margin by December.
$75K+ net profit after team costs.
65-70 active customers.
4+ loads per customer average.
Less than 15% churn.
No single customer more than 12% of revenue.

These are the numbers that tell us if the plan is working."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 28: Roadmap

**[TIMELINE]**

"Here's the roadmap by quarter.

**Q1 (Jan-Mar):** Foundation phase. Implement role separation. Establish protected calling time. Patrick ramps to 200 dials per week. Target: 10-15 new customers.

**Q2 (Apr-Jun):** Scale phase. Hire Sales Rep #2 when Patrick proves the system. Potentially hire Ops Coordinator. Target: 15-20 new customers.

**Q3 (Jul-Sep):** Accelerate phase. Rep #2 ramping. Hire Rep #3 if triggers hit. Target: 15-20 new customers.

**Q4 (Oct-Dec):** Optimize phase. Full team executing. Fine-tune processes. Hit $100K target."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 29: Pipeline Stages

**[SALES PROCESS]**

"For clarity, here are the pipeline stages Patrick will track.

1. Lead: Identified target, not yet contacted
2. Contacted: Had initial conversation
3. Qualified: Has freight, fits our profile, has decision-making authority
4. Quote Sent: Pricing delivered
5. Negotiating: Working through terms
6. Won: First load booked

Each stage has clear entry criteria. Chris will review pipeline weekly with Patrick."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

## ACT 7: MUTUAL COMMITMENT (Slides 30-32)
*Goal: Partnership and SHARED OWNERSHIP*

---

### SLIDE 30: First 30 Days

**[IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS]**

"Here's what happens in the first 30 days.

**Week 1:** Role transition begins. Protected calling time starts. Patrick hits 200 dials this week.

**Week 2:** Handoff protocol implemented. First customers transitioned to David. Pipeline review established.

**Week 3-4:** Full execution mode. Daily tracking active. Weekly reviews with Chris and Vin. First new customers under new system.

We're not waiting to start. This begins Monday."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 31: Success Criteria

**[HOW WE KNOW IT'S WORKING]**

"How will we know this is working?

**30-day check:** Patrick consistently hitting 200 dials per week. Protected time is protected. First 2-3 new customers acquired.

**60-day check:** Pipeline building predictably. 5-8 new customers total. Operations running smoothly with David.

**90-day check:** Patrick proving 4+ customers per month. Trigger met for Sales Rep #2 hire.

If these milestones aren't hit, we diagnose and adjust. We're committed to making this work, which means we're committed to learning and adapting."

**[ADVANCE]**

---

### SLIDE 32: Commitment

**[CLOSE STRONG]**

"So here's what I'm asking.

Patrick, I'm asking you to commit to 200 dials per week and trust that we'll protect your time. In return, I commit to giving you the structure, support, and leads to succeed.

David, I'm asking you to own operations completely and trust that we'll get you help before you burn out. In return, I commit to having the Ops Coordinator ready when you hit 120 loads.

This isn't me telling you what to do. This is a partnership. We're all committing to our part.

The foundation is built. The math works. The plan is clear. Now we execute.

**Questions?**"

---

## POST-PRESENTATION NOTES

**Key objections to be ready for:**

1. "What if I can't hit 200 dials?"
   - Response: Chris is there to coach. We'll diagnose what's blocking you. The system supports you.

2. "What if customers want to talk to Patrick after handoff?"
   - Response: Handoff protocol is clear. Relationship escalations only. David handles 95%+.

3. "What if we don't hit the hiring triggers?"
   - Response: Then we diagnose why. Is it the system or the market? We adapt.

4. "This is a lot of change."
   - Response: It is. But the alternative is staying stuck at $11K/month. The current structure has a ceiling.

**Follow-up actions:**
- Send deck link to team
- Schedule Week 1 check-in
- Set up dashboard access
- Chris/Patrick: first 1:1 this week
- Vin/David: first daily sync tomorrow
