# Patrick's Role & Commitments
## 2026 Growth Strategy Reference Card

## Your Role

**100% Sales Focus** — New customer acquisition is your only job.

---

## What You Own

| Area | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **New Customer Acquisition** | Finding, qualifying, and closing new accounts |
| **First Load Relationship** | Book and monitor the first load personally |
| **Customer Handoff** | Introduce David after successful first delivery |
| **Your Schedule** | You control your call priorities and approach |
| **CRM Activity Tracking** | Daily logging of calls, conversations, quotes |

---

## What You Don't Own

- Day-to-day operations after handoff → **David**
- Carrier issues → **David**
- Customer service escalations (unless relationship-critical) → **David**
- Quote requests from existing customers → **David**

---

## Protected Calling Time

**8:00 AM - 12:00 PM Daily**

During this time:
- No meetings
- No operations issues
- No interruptions
- No exceptions

Leadership has committed to enforcing this. If someone pulls you into ops during protected time, escalate to Chris or Jason immediately.

---

## Weekly Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Dials** | 200 | ~40/day during protected time |
| **Conversations** | 40 | 20% connection rate |
| **Quotes Sent** | 4 | 10% quote rate from conversations |
| **Pipeline Value** | Track | Document in CRM |

---

## Monthly Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **New Customers** | 4 |
| **Conversion Rate** | Monitor and improve |

---

## Your Support System

**Chris (Sales Lead)**
- Weekly 1:1 coaching session
- Available for deal support within 2 hours
- Joint call on any deal over $500/month margin
- Handles pricing strategy so you focus on relationships

**When to Escalate to Chris:**
- Deal is stuck and you need coaching
- Customer wants to negotiate terms beyond standard
- You need a second voice on a call

---

## Handoff Protocol

After closing a new customer:

1. **You book and monitor the first load personally** — You made the promise, you deliver on it
2. **After successful delivery, send intro email** — Customer trust transfers with execution
3. **CC David on the intro email** — He's now their day-to-day contact
4. **David takes over ALL future operations** — You stay on sales
5. **Document customer in HubSpot** — Profile, preferences, notes
6. **Stay available for relationship escalations only** — 95%+ goes through David

---

## Growth Path

| Now | Milestone | Future |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Sales Rep | 4+ customers/month consistently | Sales Lead |

If you prove the system works and we hire Rep #2 and Rep #3, the Sales Lead role is yours.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By December 2026:
- You've closed 40+ customers
- You've proven the sales system works
- Rep #2 and Rep #3 are following your playbook
- You're leading the sales team

---

## If You're Struggling

**What happens if you can't hit 200 dials?**

We coach and adjust. Maybe it's call quality over quantity. Maybe it's better targeting. We figure it out together — not blame.

**What happens if conversion drops?**

We analyze the funnel. Is it targeting? Messaging? Competition? We diagnose the root cause and fix it.

**What happens if operations pulls you back?**

Escalate immediately to Chris or Jason. We committed to protecting your time. Hold us to it.

---

## Key Contacts

| Person | Role | When to Contact |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Chris** | Sales Lead | Coaching, deal support, escalations |
| **David** | Operations | Post-handoff customer questions |
| **Jason** | President | Strategic issues, blocked decisions |

---

## Remember

You're not just executing a plan — you're proving a system that others will follow.

The whole growth strategy depends on you succeeding. We've restructured everything to give you the best chance. Now show us what you can do.
