## Part 1: Logging Calls (Dials)

### Every call counts as a "dial" IF:
- You log it in HubSpot
- You mark the status as **"Completed"**

### How to log a call:

1. **From a Contact or Company record:**
   - Click the **"Log"** button (or "Log activity")
   - Select **"Call"**
   - Set **Outcome** to "Connected" or "No answer" (doesn't matter for dial count)
   - **CRITICAL:** Make sure **Call status = "Completed"**
   - Click **Save**

2. **Using HubSpot mobile app:**
   - Same process - log the call after you make it
   - Status must be "Completed"

### What counts as a "Conversation" (not just a dial):

A call becomes a **conversation** (tracked separately) if EITHER:
- Call duration is **longer than 60 seconds**, OR
- You add **notes** to the call log

**Tip:** Always add brief notes for meaningful calls. This helps track real conversations vs. voicemails.

## Part 2: Managing Your Pipeline (Deals)

### The BBL Sales Pipeline Stages:

| Stage | What It Means | When to Move Here |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1. New Lead** | You identified them, haven't reached out yet | Starting point |
| **2. Contacted** | You've attempted outreach (call/email) | After first attempt |
| **3. Engaged** | You've had a two-way conversation | After they respond/talk back |
| **4. Qualified** | They have freight, can make decisions, have timeline | After discovery call |
| **5. Quote Sent** | You've sent them pricing | After emailing rates |
| **6. Negotiating** | Discussing terms, rates, details | Active back-and-forth |
| **7. First Load Booked** | Trial shipment is scheduled | Load is on the books |
| **8. Won – Active Customer** | They're giving us repeat business | After 2nd+ load |

### How to create a deal:

1. Go to **Sales > Deals**
2. Click **"Create deal"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Deal name:** Company name or descriptive name
   - **Pipeline:** Select "BBL Sales Pipeline"
   - **Deal stage:** Start at "New Lead" or wherever appropriate
   - **Amount:** Estimated monthly margin (optional but helpful)
   - **Close date:** When you expect to close them
   - **Deal owner:** Make sure it's set to YOU

### How to move a deal through stages:

1. Open the deal
2. Click the **stage dropdown** at the top
3. Select the new stage
4. The dashboard updates automatically

**Important:** Move deals promptly! The dashboard shows your pipeline in real-time.

## Part 3: Daily Workflow

### Morning (before calls):
1. Open HubSpot
2. Check your **Tasks** for follow-ups
3. Review your **Pipeline** - any deals need attention?

### During calling block (8am-12pm):
1. Make your calls
2. **Log each call immediately after** (takes 10 seconds)
3. Add brief notes for real conversations
4. Update deal stages when appropriate

### End of day:
1. Quick pipeline review
2. Create tasks for tomorrow's follow-ups
3. Update any deal stages you missed

## Part 4: What the Dashboard Tracks

### Your daily/weekly targets:

| Metric | Daily Target | Weekly Target |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Dials | 40 | 200 |
| Conversations | 8 | 40 |
| Qualified Prospects | - | 10 |
| New Customers | - | 4-5/month |

### How each metric is calculated:

**Dials Today/This Week:**
- All calls you logged with status = "Completed"
- Filtered by date

**Conversations This Week:**
- Calls that are 60+ seconds long OR have notes
- This separates real talks from voicemails

**Qualified Prospects:**
- Deals in stages 4-7 (Qualified through First Load Booked)
- Shows your active pipeline

**New Customers MTD:**
- Deals moved to "Won – Active Customer" this month
- This is the ultimate metric

**Pipeline Value:**
- Sum of deal amounts in active stages
- Helps forecast revenue

## Part 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not logging calls
**Problem:** Your dials don't show up
**Fix:** Log every call, even no-answers. Takes 10 seconds.

### 2. Forgetting to mark "Completed"
**Problem:** Call doesn't count as a dial
**Fix:** Always check the status dropdown says "Completed"

### 3. Not adding notes to real conversations
**Problem:** Dashboard can't tell conversation from voicemail
**Fix:** Add even brief notes: "Spoke with John, has 5 loads/week, following up Thursday"

### 4. Leaving deals in wrong stage
**Problem:** Pipeline looks inaccurate
**Fix:** Update stages as soon as something changes

### 5. Not assigning yourself as deal owner
**Problem:** Deal doesn't show in your metrics
**Fix:** Check "Deal owner" field is set to your name

## Part 6: HubSpot Mobile App Tips

The mobile app is great for logging calls on the go:

1. **Download:** HubSpot app (iOS/Android)
2. **Log calls:** Tap contact > Log > Call
3. **Quick notes:** Use voice-to-text for fast notes
4. **Check pipeline:** Deals tab shows your pipeline

---

## Part 7: Quick Troubleshooting

### "My calls aren't showing up"
- Check call status = "Completed"
- Make sure you're logging on the right contact/company
- Verify the date is correct

### "My deal isn't in the pipeline"
- Check it's in "BBL Sales Pipeline" (not a different pipeline)
- Verify you're the deal owner
- Make sure it's not in "Lost" stage

### "Dashboard shows wrong numbers"
- Dashboard refreshes periodically
- Check if you logged activity on the right date
- Verify deal stages are current
